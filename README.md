## 🚀 Introduction  

Hex Generator is a lightweight Node.js package that generates a random hex color code for styling your app. It outputs a random color in the form of a hex code, and the text displaying the color will appear in the color it represents. Perfect for dynamic styling or creative development.

With Hex Generator, you can quickly generate random colors for your web applications, terminal styling, or just for fun!

## 📦 Installation  

You can install **Hex Generator** via npm:  
   ```

## 📖 Usage  

Hex Generator works through the command line interface (CLI). After installation, you can generate a random hex color by running the following command:
   ```
npx random-hex-color
   ```
Alternatively, you can call it directly from the command line like this (if you install it globally):
   ```
random-hex-color
   ```

Each time you run the command, it will print a random color and show the text in that color.

## 🎨 Generated Color

Each time you run the command, a random hex color code will be generated, and the message will be displayed in that color.

Example output:
<span style="color:#A3F7D7">Your random color is: #A3F7D7</span>.

The text will appear in any other randomly generated hex color.

## ⚙️ Configuration  

Hex Generator works out of the box. There are currently no additional configuration options, but future versions may include options for custom color formats or specific color ranges.
